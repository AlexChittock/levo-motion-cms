# Early Morning Yoga
Based in Ashtanga Yoga, Early Morning Yoga is designed to get you to move. For better or worse, the majority of us spend vast amounts of the day desk-bound, locked behind computer screens. If this is you, then Early Morning Yoga is the remedy for the constraints of modern life. The focus is primarily on standing postures and movement, and you will leave feeling invigorated and ready to tackle whatever your day has in store for you.

**Costs:** Included with LWFitness4all membership; &pound;5 for non-members
