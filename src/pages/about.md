# Bio
2018 marks the 15th year of my involvement in the health, fitness, and well-being industry. Over the years I have been fortunate enough to have studied a wide array of movement modalities under some remarkable individuals, Pavel Tsatsouline, Steve Maxwell, Mark Cheng, and Christopher Sommer, to name a few. However, my yoga journey began with one person and one person alone: my wife, Aly. An accomplish Yoga instructor in her own right, Aly was the person that planted the seed that would later grow into the multifaceted, diverse, and holistic approach that I take in both teaching and practicing yoga and movement. My perspective towards teaching, yoga, and movement, in general, was further refined through studying the Stretch Therapy System under its founder, Kit Laughlin, and its most senior instructor, Olivia Allnutt, and through my Ashtanga Yoga studies with Martin Thompson. Finally, my coach and mentor Steve Atlas, of the Atlas Movement solidified my belief in the use of a broad spectrum of physical culture practices and teaching methodology that is unique to each student.
